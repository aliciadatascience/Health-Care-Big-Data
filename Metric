Predictive models:
1) classification: target variable y is either binary or categorical.
    metrics: 
        1). true positive rate = sensitivity = recall: true positive/condition positive = true positive / (true positive + False negative);
        2). false negative rate = false negative / condition positive = 1 - true positive rate
        3). false positive rate = false positive / condition negative = false positive / (false positive + true negative)
        4). true negative rate = specificity = true negative / condition negative = true negative / (true negative + false positive)
        5) prevalence = condition positive / total population, which measures how likely the disease occurs in the total population.
        6) positive predictive values = precision = True positive / prediction outcome positive = True positive / (true positive + false positive)
        7) negative predictive value = true negative / prediction outcome negative = true negative / (true negative + false negative)
        8) F1 score
        9) accuracy: (true positive + true negative)/total population
        10) area under the ROC(receiver operating characteristic) curve(AUC): ROC curve provide a way to compare different classifiers as predition boundary is varied. ROC curves is ploted by true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold values.
        Since AUC doesn't depend on the choice of the threshold, it becomes the most popular performance metric for classification problems.
        
 2) regression: target y is continuous
    metrics:
        mean absolute error
        mean squared error
        R square
